## **Import data from documents in different formats to OneNote**

Time to time it is useful to import a piece content from documents in different formats. 
Microsoft OneNote dektop app doesn't provide any import functionality except copy-paste.

Aspose.Note for .Net fills this gap and provides support for import of data from documents in Pdf format.
Also we plan to support import from documents in format DocX, MarkDdwn and other in the future.
