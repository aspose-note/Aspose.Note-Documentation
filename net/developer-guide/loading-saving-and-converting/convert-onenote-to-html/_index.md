Html is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It defines the structure of web page content. The markup specifies how web browsers should display a text/images/tables/etc on the web page. 
Beside Html technologies like CSS and JavaScript are widely used.
CSS is responsible for page's appearance/presentation and JavaScript allows to add various functionality.

A lot of user devices are capable of processing Html by using Web browsers like Chrome/Safary/Opera/etc.
It allows freely distribute and share Html content to any platform without cost.


Using Microsoft OneNote desktop app you can export your notes to MHtml format:
1. Select pages you want to export by holding Ctrl + mouse right-click 
2. Choose File -> Export
3. Under 'Export Current' choose what to export
4. Under 'Select Format' choose option for Single File Web Page format
5. Press export and specify destination file name

All selected content will be saved to specified file.

Using latest version of Aspose.Note you can:

2. Handle absent fonts.
3. Control how resources like fonts/images/css are saved.
