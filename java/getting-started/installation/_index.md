## **Installing Aspose.Note for Java from Maven Repository**
Aspose hosts all Java APIs on [Aspose Artifactory](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/home). You can easily use [Aspose.Note for Java](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-note) API directly in your Maven Projects with simple configurations.
### **Specify Maven Repository Configuration**
First, you need to specify the Aspose Maven Repository configuration/location in your Maven pom.xml as follows:

{{< highlight java >}}

    <repository>

        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>

        <name>Aspose Java API</name>

        <url>https://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>

    </repository>

</repositories>
