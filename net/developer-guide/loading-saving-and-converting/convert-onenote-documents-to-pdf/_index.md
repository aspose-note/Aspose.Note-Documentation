PDF documents are widely used as a standard format of exchanging documents between organizations, government sectors, and individuals. It's a popular format so developers are often asked to convert Microsoft OneNote documents to PDF documents. For this purpose, Aspose.Note for .NET supports converting OneNote to PDF documents without using any other component. This topic illustrates how this conversion can be done.

Aspose.Note for .NET offers the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/note/net/aspose.note/document) class that represents a OneNote file. The Document class exposes the Save method that can be called to convert a OneNote document into a PDF document. The [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/note/net/aspose.note.saving/pdfsaveoptions) class provides options for creating the PDF such as PageIndex, PageCount and others.
