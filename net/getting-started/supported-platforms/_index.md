## **.NET Framework**
You can confidently use Aspose.Note for .NET to build any type of x86 or x64 (32-bit or 64-bit) .NET application including ASP.NET, Web Services, and WinForms. Aspose.Note for .NET is easy to deploy because it consists of just a single assembly without any dependencies (except on the .NET Framework itself). Aspose.Note.dll is CLS compliant, written entirely in C#, and contains only safe managed code. Aspose.Note for .NET supports all versions of the Microsoft .NET Framework from 2.0 to 5.0. A single MSI installer is provided that caters both for 32-bit and 64-bit environments. 
## **.NET Standard 2.0**
The [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The motivation behind the .NET Standard is establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. The 'netstandard2.0' folder contains Aspose.Note assemblies to use with frameworks that implement .NET Standard 2.0 such as .NET Core 2.0.
